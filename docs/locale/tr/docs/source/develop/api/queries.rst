Queries
=======

A query is a request related to certain part of World State View — the latest state of blockchain.
Query cannot modify the contents of the chain and a response is returned
to any client immediately after receiving peer has processed a query.

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

The validation for all queries includes:

- timestamp — shouldn't be from the past (24 hours prior to the peer time) or from the future (range of 5 minutes added to the peer time)
- signature of query creator — used for checking the identity of query creator
- query counter — checked to be incremented with every subsequent query from query creator
- roles — depending on the query creator's role: the range of state available to query can relate to to the same account, account in the domain, to the whole chain, or not allowed at all

Result Pagination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some queries support `TxPaginationMeta` that allows to customise and sort the query result in different ways what could be used in development.
Pagination works together with ordering prameters, similar to `ORDER BY in SQL language <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-select.html#SQL-ORDERBY>`_ – "the result rows are sorted according to the specified expression (in Iroha – Field). If two rows are equal according to the leftmost expression, they are compared according to the next expression and so on."

Here is how the "expression" is specified:

.. code-block:: proto

    enum Field {
      kCreatedTime = 0;
      kPosition = 1;
    }

There are 2 bases for ordering – on creation time and depending on the position in the block.

There is an ascending and descending directions for each Field:

.. code-block:: proto

    enum Direction {
      kAscending = 0;
      kDescending = 1;
    }

Now, the ordering itself:

.. code-block:: proto

    message Ordering {
      message FieldOrdering {
        Field field = 1;
        Direction direction = 2;
      }
      repeated FieldOrdering sequence = 1;
    }

After ordering is specified, pagination can be executed:

.. code-block:: proto

    message TxPaginationMeta {
        uint32 page_size = 1;
        oneof opt_first_tx_hash {
            string first_tx_hash = 2;
        }
        Ordering ordering = 3;
    }

What is added to the request structure in case of pagination
------------------------------------------------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Page size", "size of the page to be returned by the query, if the response contains fewer transactions than a page size, then next tx hash will be empty in response", "page_size > 0", "5"
    "First tx hash", "hash of the first transaction in the page. If that field is not set — then the first transactions are returned", "hash in hex format", "bddd58404d1315e0eb27902c5d7c8eb0602c16238f005773df406bc191308929"
    "ordering", "how the results should be ordered (before pagination is applied)", "see fields below", "see fields below"
    "ordering.sequence", "ordeing spec, like in SQL ORDER BY", "sequence of fields and directions", "[{kCreatedTime, kAscending}, {kPosition, kDescending}]"

Get Transactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

GetTransactions is used for retrieving information about transactions, based on their hashes.

.. note:: This query is valid if and only if all the requested hashes are correct: corresponding transactions exist, and the user has a permission to retrieve them

Request Schema
--------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message GetTransactions {
        repeated bytes tx_hashes = 1;
    }

Get Pending Transactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

GetPendingTransactions is used for retrieving a list of pending (not fully signed) `multisignature transactions <../../concepts_architecture/glossary.html#multisignature-transactions>`_
or `batches of transactions <../../concepts_architecture/glossary.html#batch-of-transactions>`__ issued by account of query creator.

.. note:: This query uses `pagination <#result-pagination>`_ for quicker and more convenient query responses. Please read about it and specify pagination before sending the query request as well as `the request structure <#what-is-added-to-the-request-structure-in-case-of-pagination>`_.

Request Schema
--------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message GetPendingTransactions {
        TxPaginationMeta pagination_meta = 1;
    }

All the user's semi-signed multisignature (pending) transactions can be queried.
Maximum amount of transactions contained in a response can be limited by **page_size** field.
All the pending transactions are stored till they have collected enough signatures or get expired.
The mutual order of pending transactions or batches of transactions is preserved for a user.
That allows a user to query all transactions sequentially - page by page.
Each response may contain a reference to the next batch or transaction that can be queried.
A page size can be greater than the size of the following batch (in transactions).
In that case, several batches or transactions will be returned.
During navigating over pages, the following batch can collect the missing signatures before it gets queried.
This will result in stateful failed query response due to a missing hash of the batch.

Example
-------

If there are two pending batches with three transactions each and a user queries pending transactions
with page size 5, then the transactions of the first batch will be in the response and a reference
(first transaction hash and batch size, even if it is a single transaction in fact) to the second batch
will be specified too.
Transactions of the second batch are not included in the first response because the batch cannot be devided
into several parts and only complete batches can be contained in a response.

Response Schema
---------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message PendingTransactionsPageResponse {
        message BatchInfo {
            string first_tx_hash = 1;
            uint32 batch_size = 2;
        }
        repeated Transaction transactions = 1;
        uint32 all_transactions_size = 2;
        BatchInfo next_batch_info = 3;
    }

Response Structure
------------------

The response contains a list of `pending transactions <../../concepts_architecture/glossary.html#pending-transactions>`_,
the amount of all stored pending transactions for the user
and the information required to query the subsequent page (if exists).

        "All transactions size", "the number of stored transactions", "all_transactions_size >= 0", "0"
        "Next batch info", "A reference to the next page - the message might be not set in a response", "", ""
        "First tx hash", "hash of the first transaction in the next batch",  "hash in hex format", "bddd58404d1315e0eb27902c5d7c8eb0602c16238f005773df406bc191308929"

Get Account Detail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

To get details of the account, `GetAccountDetail` query can be used. Account details are key-value pairs, splitted into writers categories. Writers are accounts, that added the corresponding account detail. Example of such structure is:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18,
            "hobbies": "crypto"
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

Here, one can see four account details - "age", "hobbies" and "sports" - added by two writers - "account@a_domain" and "account@b_domain". All of these details, obviously, are about the same account.

Request Schema
--------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message AccountDetailRecordId {
      string writer = 1;
      string key = 2;
    }

    message AccountDetailPaginationMeta {
      uint32 page_size = 1;
      AccountDetailRecordId first_record_id = 2;
    }

    message GetAccountDetail {
      oneof opt_account_id {
        string account_id = 1;
      }
      oneof opt_key {
        string key = 2;
      }
      oneof opt_writer {
        string writer = 3;
      }
      AccountDetailPaginationMeta pagination_meta = 4;
    }

.. note::
    Pay attention, that all fields except pagination meta are optional.
    The reasons for that are described below.

.. warning::
    Pagination metadata can be missing in the request for compatibility reasons, but this behaviour is deprecated and should be avoided.

Request Structure
-----------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

        "Account ID", "account id to get details from", "<account_name>@<domain_id>", "account@domain"
        "Key", "key, under which to get details", "string", "age"
        "Writer", "account id of writer", "<account_name>@<domain_id>", "account@domain"
        AccountDetailPaginationMeta.page_size, "Requested page size. The number of records in response will not exceed this value. If the response was truncated, the record id immediately following the returned ones will be provided in next_record_id.", 0 < page_size < 32 bit unsigned int max (4294967296), 100
        AccountDetailPaginationMeta.first_record_id.writer, requested page start by writer, name#domain, my_asset#my_domain
        AccountDetailPaginationMeta.first_record_id.key, requested page start by key, string, age

.. note::
    When specifying first record id, it is enough to provide the attributes (writer, key) that are unset in the main query.

Response Schema
---------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message AccountDetailResponse {
      string detail = 1;
      uint64 total_number = 2;
      AccountDetailRecordId next_record_id = 3;
    }

Response Structure
------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

        "Detail", "key-value pairs with account details", "JSON", "see below"
        total_number, number of records matching query without page limits, 0 < total_number < 32 bit unsigned int max (4294967296), 100
        next_record_id.writer, the writer account of the record immediately following curent page, <account_name>@<domain_id>, pushkin@lyceum.tsar
        next_record_id.key, the key of the record immediately following curent page, string, "cold and sun"

Possible Stateful Validation Errors
-----------------------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Code", "Error Name", "Description", "How to solve"

    "1", "Could not get account detail", "Internal error happened", "Try again or contact developers"
    "2", "No such permissions", "Query's creator does not have any of the permissions to get account detail", "Grant the necessary permission: individual, global or domain one"
    "3", "Invalid signatures", "Signatures of this query did not pass validation", "Add more signatures and make sure query's signatures are a subset of account's signatories"
    "4", "Invalid pagination metadata", "Wrong page size or nonexistent first record", "Set valid page size, and make sure that the first record id is valid, or leave the first record id unspecified"

Usage Examples
--------------

Again, let's consider the example of details from the beginning and see how different variants of `GetAccountDetail` queries will change the resulting response.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18,
            "hobbies": "crypto"
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

**account_id is not set**

If account_id is not set - other fields can be empty or not - it will automatically be substituted with query creator's account, which will lead to one of the next cases.

**only account_id is set**

In this case, all details about that account are going to be returned, leading to the following response:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18,
            "hobbies": "crypto"
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

**account_id and key are set**

Here, details added by all writers under the key are going to be returned. For example, if we asked for the key "age", that's the response we would get:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20
        }
    }

**account_id and writer are set**

Now, the response will contain all details about this account, added by one specific writer. For example, if we asked for writer "account@b_domain", we would get:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

**account_id, key and writer are set**

Finally, if all three field are set, result will contain details, added the specific writer and under the specific key, for example, if we asked for key "age" and writer "account@a_domain", we would get:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18
        }
    }

Get Asset Info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

In order to get information on the given asset (as for now - its precision), user can send `GetAssetInfo` query.

Request Schema
--------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message GetAssetInfo {
        string asset_id = 1;
    }

Request Structure
-----------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Asset ID", "asset id to know related information", "<asset_name>#<domain_id>", "jpy#japan"


Response Schema
---------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message Asset {
        string asset_id = 1;
        string domain_id = 2;
        uint32 precision = 3;
    }

.. note::
    Please note that due to a known issue you would not get any exception if you pass invalid precision value.
    Valid range is: 0 <= precision <= 255

Possible Stateful Validation Errors

Get Peers
^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

A query that returns a list of peers in Iroha network.

Request Schema
--------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message GetPeers {
    }

Response Schema
---------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message Peer {
      string address = 1;
      string peer_key = 2; // hex string
    }

    message PeersResponse {
      repeated Peer peers = 1;
    }

Response Structure
------------------

A list of peers with their addresses and public keys is returned.

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Peers", "array of peers from the network", "non-empty list of peers", "{Peer{""peer.domain.com"", ""292a8714694095edce6be799398ed5d6244cd7be37eb813106b217d850d261f2""}, …}"

Possible Stateful Validation Errors
-----------------------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Code", "Error Name", "Description", "How to solve"

    "1", "Could not get peers", "Internal error happened", "Try again or contact developers"
    "2", "No such permissions", "Query creator does not have enough permissions to get peers", "Append a role with can_get_blocks or can_get_peers permission"
    "3", "Invalid signatures", "Signatures of this query did not pass validation", "Add more signatures and make sure query's signatures are a subset of account's signatories"

.. warning::

    Currently Get Peers query uses "can_get_blocks" permission for compatibility purposes.
    Later that will be changed to "can_get_peers" with the next major Iroha release.

Fetch Commits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

To get new blocks as soon as they are committed, a user can invoke `FetchCommits` RPC call to Iroha network.

Request Schema
--------------

No request arguments are needed


Response Schema
---------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message BlockQueryResponse {
      oneof response {
        BlockResponse block_response = 1;
        BlockErrorResponse block_error_response = 2;
      }
    }

    message BlockResponse {
      Block block = 1;
    }

    message BlockErrorResponse {
      string message = 1;
    }

Please note that it returns a stream of `BlockQueryResponse`.

Response Structure
------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Block", "Iroha block", "only committed blocks", "{ 'block_v1': ....}"

Possible Stateful Validation Errors
-----------------------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Code", "Error Name", "Description", "How to solve"

    "1", "Could not get block streaming", "Internal error happened", "Try again or contact developers"
    "2", "No such permissions", "Query's creator does not have any of the permissions to get blocks", "Grant `can_get_block <permissions.html#can-get-blocks>`__ permission"
    "3", "Invalid signatures", "Signatures of this query did not pass validation", "Add more signatures and make sure query's signatures are a subset of account's signatories"

.. note::
    `BlockErrorResponse` contains only `message` field.
    In case of stateful validation error it will be "stateful invalid".
    `GetBlock <#get-block>`__ requires same `can_get_block <permissions.html#can-get-blocks>`__ permission.
    Therefore, it can be used with `height = 1` (first block is always present) to check for invalid signatories or insufficient permissions.
