Commands
========

A command changes the state, called World State View, by performing an action over an entity (asset, account) in the system.
Any command should be included in a transaction to perform an action.

Add asset quantity
------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^

The purpose of add asset quantity command is to increase the quantity of an asset on account of transaction creator.
Use case scenario is to increase the number of a mutable asset in the system, which can act as a claim on a commodity (e.g. money, gold, etc.)

Schema
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: proto

    message AddAssetQuantity {
        string asset_id = 1;
        string amount = 2;
    }

.. note::
    Please note that due to a known issue you would not get any exception if you pass invalid precision value.
    Valid range is: 0 <= precision <= 255


Structure
^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Asset ID", "id of the asset", "<asset_name>#<domain_id>", "usd#morgan"
    "Amount", "positive amount of the asset to add", "> 0", "200.02"

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

1. Asset and account should exist
2. Added quantity precision should be equal to asset precision
3. Creator of a transaction should have a role which has permissions for issuing assets

Possible Stateful Validation Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Code", "Error Name", "Description", "How to solve"

    "1", "Could not add asset quantity", "Internal error happened", "Try again or contact developers"
    "2", "No such permissions", "Command's creator does not have permission to add asset quantity", "Grant the necessary permission"
    "3", "No such asset", "Cannot find asset with such name or such precision", "Make sure asset id and precision are correct"
    "4", "Summation overflow", "Resulting asset quantity is greater than the system can support", "Make sure that resulting quantity is less than 2^256 / 10^asset_precision"

Add peer
--------

Purpose
^^^^^^^

The purpose of add peer command is to write into ledger the fact of peer addition into the peer network.
After a transaction with AddPeer has been committed, consensus and synchronization components will start using it.

Schema
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: proto

    message Peer {
        string address = 1;
        bytes peer_key = 2; // hex string
    }

    message AddPeer {
        Peer peer = 1;
    }

Structure
^^^^^^^^^

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

1. Peer key is unique (there is no other peer with such public key)
2. Creator of the transaction has a role which has CanAddPeer permission
3. Such network address has not been already added

Possible Stateful Validation Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    message AddSignatory {
        string account_id = 1;
        bytes public_key = 2;
    }

Subtract asset quantity
-----------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^

The purpose of subtract asset quantity command is the opposite of AddAssetQuantity commands — to decrease the number of assets on account of transaction creator.

Schema
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: proto

    message SubtractAssetQuantity {
        string asset_id = 1;
        string amount = 2;
    }

.. note::
    Please note that due to a known issue you would not get any exception if you pass invalid precision value.
    Valid range is: 0 <= precision <= 255

Structure
^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Asset ID", "id of the asset", "<asset_name>#<domain_id>", "usd#morgan"
    "Amount", "positive amount of the asset to subtract", "> 0", "200"

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

1. Asset and account should exist
2. Added quantity precision should be equal to asset precision
3. Creator of the transaction should have a role which has permissions for subtraction of assets

Possible Stateful Validation Errors

    "1", "Could not subtract asset quantity", "Internal error happened", "Try again or contact developers"
    "2", "No such permissions", "Command's creator does not have permission to subtract asset quantity", "Grant the necessary permission"
    "3", "No such asset found", "Cannot find asset with such name or precision in account's assets", "Make sure asset name and precision are correct"
    "4", "Not enough balance", "Account's balance is too low to perform the operation", "Add asset to account or choose lower value to subtract"

Transfer asset
--------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^

The purpose of transfer asset command is to share assets within the account in peer network: in the way that source account transfers assets to the target account.

Schema
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: proto

    message TransferAsset {
        string src_account_id = 1;
        string dest_account_id = 2;
        string asset_id = 3;
        string description = 4;
        string amount = 5;
    }

Structure
^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Source account ID", "ID of the account to withdraw the asset from", "already existent", "makoto@soramitsu"
    "Destination account ID", "ID of the account to send the asset to", "already existent", "alex@california"
    "Asset ID", "ID of the asset to transfer", "already existent", "usd#usa"
    "Description", "Message to attach to the transfer", "Max length of description (set in genesis block, by default is 100*1024)", "here's my money take it"
    "Amount", "amount of the asset to transfer", "0 <= precision <= 255", "200.20"

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

1. Source account has this asset in its AccountHasAsset relation [#f1]_
2. An amount is a positive number and asset precision is consistent with the asset definition
3. Source account has enough amount of asset to transfer and is not zero
4. Source account can transfer money, and destination account can receive money (their roles have these permissions)
5. Description length is less than 100*1024 (one hundred kilobytes) and less than 'MaxDescriptionSize' setting value if set.

Compare and Set Account Detail
------------------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Purpose of compare and set account detail command is to set key-value information for a given account if the old value matches the value passed.

Schema
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: proto

    message CompareAndSetAccountDetail{
        string account_id = 1;
        string key = 2;
        string value = 3;
        oneof opt_old_value {
            string old_value = 4;
        }
        bool check_empty = 5;
    }

.. note::
    Pay attention, that old_value field is optional.
    This is due to the fact that the key-value pair might not exist.

Structure
^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Account ID", "id of the account to which the key-value information was set. If key-value pair doesnot exist , then it will be created", "an existing account", "artyom@soramitsu"
    "Key", "key of information being set", "`[A-Za-z0-9_]{1,64}`", "Name"
    "Value", "new value for the corresponding key", "length of value ≤ 4096", "Artyom"
    "Old value", "current value for the corresponding key", "length of value ≤ 4096", "Artem"
    "check_empty", "if true, empty old_value in command must match absent value in WSV; if false, any old_value in command matches absent in WSV (legacy)", "bool", "true"

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

Three cases:

    Case 1. When transaction creator wants to set account detail to his/her account and he or she has permission GetMyAccountDetail / GetAllAccountsDetail / GetDomainAccountDetail

    Case 2. When transaction creator wants to set account detail to another account and he or she has permissions SetAccountDetail and GetAllAccountsDetail / GetDomainAccountDetail

    Case 3. SetAccountDetail permission was granted to transaction creator and he or she has permission GetAllAccountsDetail / GetDomainAccountDetail

Possible Stateful Validation Errors

    :header: "Code", "Error Name", "Description", "How to solve"

    "1", "Could not compare and set account detail", "Internal error happened", "Try again or contact developers"
    "2", "No such permissions", "Command's creator does not have permission to set and read account detail for this account", "Grant the necessary permission"

    "4", "No match values", "Old values do not match", "Make sure old value is correct"
