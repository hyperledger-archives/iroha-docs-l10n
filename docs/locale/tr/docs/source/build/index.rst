Building Iroha
==============

In this guide we will learn how to install all dependencies, required to build
Iroha and how to actually build it.

There will be 3 steps:

#. Installing environment prerequisites

#. Installing Iroha dependencies (will be performed automatically for Docker)

#. Building Iroha

.. note:: You don't need to build Iroha to start using it.
  Instead, you can download prepared Docker image from the Hub,
  this process explained in details in the :ref:`getting-started` page of this documentation.

Prerequisites
=============

In order to successfully build Iroha, we need to configure the environment.
There are several ways to do it and we will describe all of them.

Currently, we support Unix-like systems (we are basically targeting popular
Linux distros and MacOS). If you happen to have Windows or you don't want to
spend time installing all dependencies you might want to consider using Docker
environment. Also, Windows users might consider using
`WSL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux>`_

Technically Iroha can be built under Windows natively in experimental mode.
This guide covers that way too.
All the stages related to native Windows build are separated from the main flow due to its significant differences.

Please choose your preferred platform below for a quick access:

    - :ref:`docker-pre`
    - :ref:`linux-pre`
    - :ref:`MacOS-pre`
    - :ref:`Windows-pre`


.. hint:: Having troubles? Check FAQ section or communicate to us directly, in
  case you were stuck on something. We don't expect this to happen, but some
  issues with an environment are possible.

.. _docker-pre:

Docker
^^^^^^

First of all, you need to install ``docker`` and ``docker-compose``. You can
read how to install it on the
`Docker's website <https://www.docker.com/community-edition/>`_

.. note:: Please, use the latest available docker daemon and docker-compose.

Then you should clone the `Iroha repository <https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha>`_
to the directory of your choice:

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone -b master https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha --depth=1

.. hint:: ``--depth=1`` option allows us to download only latest commit and
  save some time and bandwidth. If you want to get a full commit history, you
  can omit this option.

When it is done, you need to run the development environment. Run the
``scripts/run-iroha-dev.sh`` script:

.. code-block:: shell

  bash scripts/run-iroha-dev.sh

.. hint:: Please make sure that Docker is running before executing the script.
  MacOS users could find a Docker icon in system tray, Linux users can use
  ``systemctl start docker``

After you execute this script, the following things will happen:

#. The script will check whether you have containers with Iroha already running. Successful completion finishes with the new container shell.

#. The script will download ``hyperledger/iroha:develop-build`` and ``postgres`` images. ``hyperledger/iroha:develop-build`` image contains all development dependencies and is based on top of ``ubuntu:20.04``. ``postgres`` image is required for starting and running Iroha.

#. Two containers are created and launched.

#. The user is attached to the interactive environment for development and testing with ``iroha`` folder mounted from the host machine. Iroha folder is mounted to ``/opt/iroha`` in Docker container.

Now your are ready to build Iroha! Please go directly to `Building Iroha <#build-process>`_ section.

.. _linux-pre:

Linux
^^^^^

To build Iroha, you will need the following packages:

``build-essential`` ``git`` ``ca-certificates`` ``tar`` ``ninja-build`` ``curl`` ``unzip`` ``cmake``

Use this code to install environment dependencies on Debian-based Linux distro.

.. code-block:: shell

  apt-get update; \
  apt-get -y --no-install-recommends install \
  build-essential ninja-build \
  git ca-certificates tar curl unzip cmake

.. note::  If you are willing to actively develop Iroha and to build shared
  libraries, please consider installing the
  `latest release <https://cmake.org/download/>`_ of CMake.

Now you are ready to `install Iroha dependencies <#installing-dependencies-with-vcpkg-dependency-manager>`_.

.. _macos-pre:

MacOS
^^^^^

If you want to build Iroha from scratch and actively develop it, please use the following code
to install all environment dependencies with Homebrew:

.. code-block:: shell

  xcode-select --install
  brew install cmake ninja git gcc@9

.. hint:: To install the Homebrew itself please run

  ``ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homebrew/install/master/install)"``

Now you are ready to `install Iroha dependencies <#installing-dependencies-with-vcpkg-dependency-manager>`_.

.. _windows-pre:

Windows
^^^^^^^

.. note:: All the listed commands are designed for building 64-bit version of Iroha.

Chocolatey Package Manager
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

First of all you need Chocolatey package manager installed.
Please refer `the guide <https://chocolatey.org/install>`_ for chocolatey installation.

Building the Toolset
""""""""""""""""""""

Install CMake, Git, Microsoft compilers via chocolatey being in Administrative mode of command prompt:

.. code-block:: shell

  choco install cmake git visualstudio2019-workload-vctools ninja


PostgreSQL is not a build dependency, but it is recommended to install it now for the testing later:

  .. code-block:: shell

    choco install postgresql
    # Don't forget the password you set!

Now you are ready to `install Iroha dependencies <#installing-dependencies-with-vcpkg-dependency-manager>`_.

Installing dependencies with Vcpkg Dependency Manager
=====================================================

Currently we use Vcpkg as a dependency manager for all platforms - Linux, Windows and MacOS.
We use a fixed version of Vcpkg to ensure the patches we need will work.

That stable version can only be found inside the Iroha repository, so we will need to clone Iroha.
The whole process is pretty similar for all platforms but the exact commands are slightly different.

Linux and MacOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run in terminal:

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha.git
  iroha/vcpkg/build_iroha_deps.sh
  vcpkg/vcpkg integrate install

After the installation of vcpkg you will be provided with a CMake build parameter like
``-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake``.
Save it somewhere for later use and move to `Building Iroha <#build-process>`_ section.

Windows
^^^^^^^

Execute from Power Shell:

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha.git
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File .\iroha\.packer\win\scripts\vcpkg.ps1 .\vcpkg .\iroha\vcpkg

After the installation of vcpkg you will be provided with a CMake build parameter like
``-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake``.
Save it somewhere for later use and move to `Building Iroha <#build-process>`_ section.

.. note:: If you plan to build 32-bit version of Iroha -
  you will need to install all the mentioned librares above
  prefixed with ``x86`` term instead of ``x64``.

Build Process
=============

Cloning the Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This step is currently unnecessary since you have already cloned Iroha in the previous step.
But if you want, you can clone the `Iroha repository <https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha>`_ to the
directory of your choice.

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone -b master https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha
  cd iroha

.. hint:: If you have installed the prerequisites with Docker, you don't need
  to clone Iroha again, because when you run ``run-iroha-dev.sh`` it attaches
  to Iroha source code folder. Feel free to edit source code files with your
  host environment and build it within docker container.


Building Iroha
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build Iroha, use these commands:

.. code-block:: shell

  cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Ninja"
  cmake --build build --target irohad -- -j<number of threads>

.. warning:: If you want to use tests later, instead of building `irohad` target, you need to use this:

.. code-block:: shell

  cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Ninja"
  cmake --build build --target all -- -j<number of threads>

.. note:: On Docker the path to a toolchain file is ``/opt/dependencies/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake``. In other
  environment please use the path you have got in previous steps.

Number of threads will be defined differently depending on the platform:

- On Linux: via ``nproc``.
- On MacOS: with ``sysctl -n hw.ncpu``.
- On Windows: use ``echo %NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%``.

.. note:: When building on Windows do not execute this from the Power Shell. Better use x64 Native tools command prompt.

Now Iroha is built. Although, if you like, you can build it with additional parameters described below.

CMake Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use CMake to generate platform-dependent build files.
It has numerous flags for configuring the final build.
Note that besides the listed parameters cmake's variables can be useful as well.
Also as long as this page can be deprecated (or just not complete) you can browse custom flags via ``cmake -L``, ``cmake-gui``, or ``ccmake``.

.. hint::  You can specify parameters at the cmake configuring stage
  (e.g cmake -DTESTING=ON).

Running Tests (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First of all, please make sure you `built Iroha correctly <#id8>`_ for the tests.

After building Iroha, it is a good idea to run tests to check the operability
of the daemon. You can run tests with this code:

.. code-block:: shell

  cmake --build build --target test

Alternatively, you can run the following command in the ``build`` folder

.. code-block:: shell

  cd build
  ctest . --output-on-failure

.. note:: Some of the tests will fail without PostgreSQL storage running,
  so if you are not using ``scripts/run-iroha-dev.sh`` script please run Docker
  container or create a local connection with following parameters:

  .. code-block:: shell

    docker run --name some-postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -d postgres:9.5 \
    -c 'max_prepared_transactions=100'
